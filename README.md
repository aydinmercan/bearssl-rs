Use and extend BearSSL in Rust.

## Crates

* `bearssl-sys`: Autogenerated FFI bindings for BearSSL 0.6. Can use the link dynamically or bundle a build itself.
    * Versions below `0.0.5` are unrelated to this crate.
* `bearssl`: Higher level code for easier use in servers, clients, etc.
    * Versions below `0.0.2` are unrelated to this crate.

## Development

The code exists in multiple places as listed below:

* [Main Repository](https://gitea.treehouse.systems/jmercan/bearssl-rs)
    - Where the main branch resides.
    - CI tasks are planned to run here.
* [GitHub Mirror](https://github.com/aydinmercan/bearssl-rs)
    - Mainly intended to be used as a source for crate registries.
    - Short jobs such as auditing also run here.
    - Issues here are still considered but PRs will probably be merged manually.

We prefer commit signing via SSH. The allowed signers are listed in `.gitsigners`.
